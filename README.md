## Polling

## WebSocket

Bidirecional communication.

## Server-Sent Events

Unidirecional communication, from Server to Client. If you want Client to Server communication, you need do make a separated POST request.

Developers from Chromium removed the support of this feature. As Chrome has 70% of market share (2022), they are effectively killing HTTP2 Push. As HTTP2 Push is not mandatory, Chromium keeps HTTP2 compliant.
